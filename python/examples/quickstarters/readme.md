# Quickstarters Overview

Welcome to the Quickstarters folder! This directory is your gateway to exploring the power of Composio through a collection of example projects. These projects are designed to help you quickly understand how to create AI agents that can seamlessly integrate with various applications, making them 100x more useful.

## What is Composio?

Composio is a powerful platform that enables you to build intelligent agents capable of interacting with a wide range of applications, such as GitHub, Gmail, web search engines, and more. By leveraging Composio, you can create agents that automate tasks, retrieve information, and enhance productivity, all while using natural language commands.

## Subfolders

### 1. **Calendar Agent**
This project shows how to transform your to-do lists into Google Calendar events. The agent automatically schedules tasks based on your specified labels and times, keeping your calendar organized and up-to-date.

### 2. **Code Analyser**
In this example, you'll learn how to analyze your code and gain valuable insights. The agent helps identify bugs, optimize performance, and maintain best coding practices, making it easier for you to develop high-quality software.

### 3. **ARXIV Research Agent**
TThe Arxiv Research Reporter project is designed to help you automate the process of researching and reporting on academic papers from Arxiv. By leveraging the capabilities of Composio, this project enables you to create AI agents that can efficiently gather, summarize, and organize research findings, making it easier for you to stay updated with the latest developments in your field.

### 4. **RAG Agent**
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent performs web searches and compiles research reports. This example illustrates how Composio can enhance your research process by integrating various tools to gather and summarize information effectively.

### 5. **SQL Agent**
This example showcases how to create a SQL agent that executes SQL queries, documents the results, and even plots graphs based on the data. It highlights how Composio can simplify database interactions and data visualization.

### 6. **Research Assistant**
This project guides you in creating a research assistant agent that performs web searches and compiles research reports using CrewAI, Composio, and ChatGPT. It's a practical example of how to leverage AI for academic and professional research.

### 7. **AI Productivity Agent**
This AI Agent will make you a 100x productive by monitoring your screen activity, suggesting shortcuts and reminding you of your daily goals. It is powered by Composio's MultiModal local tool.
