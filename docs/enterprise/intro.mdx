## Overview

Within a single account, you can create and manage multiple independent projects. Each project exists in its own isolated environment, with complete separation of data and resources. Using your master API key, you can programmatically create and manage these projects through our [APIs](https://docs.composio.dev/api-reference/client/get-user-info).

## Project Isolation Architecture

Each project within your account is fully isolated, providing:

- Isolated entity IDs and data storage
- Project-specific admin API keys
- Segregated action execution and trigger logs
- Team management with separate permissions
