### Managing Triggers

<Steps>
<Step title="Set Global Trigger Callback URL">
Set a global callback URL to which all triggers from Composio will be sent.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Set Global Callback
  composio triggers callbacks set https://31-*****-163.ngrok.app
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  This step is crucial for receiving triggers. 
</Step>
<Step title="List All Triggers for Slack">
Identify which triggers are available for `slack` and explore potential activations.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash List Slack Triggers
  composio triggers --app slack
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Enable a Specific Trigger">
**Activate** a Slack trigger to **obtain a unique `Trigger_ID`**.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Enable a Trigger
  composio triggers enable slack_receive_message # Replace 'slack_receive_message' with your desired trigger name
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  In the output, you should get a `Trigger_ID`. This is **crucial for distinguishing** your triggers.
</Step>

<Step title="Disable a Specific Trigger">
Deactivate a trigger if it no longer meets your needs after testing.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Disable a Trigger
  composio triggers disable <trigger_id>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="List All Active Triggers">
Review all triggers that are currently active within your account.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash List all Active Triggers
  composio triggers --active
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>
