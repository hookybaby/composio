### Entities

- Each **user** is represented by a **unique entity ID**.
- If you have two users, **default** and **Melissa**, they will each have **unique entity IDs**.
- You can use an entity object to manage connected accounts and perform actions on behalf of a user, learn more [here](/patterns/tools/use-tools/action-guide-without-agents#how-can-i-use-tools-for-a-specific-user). Here's how to retrieve an entity object:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import ComposioToolSet

toolset = ComposioToolSet()
entity = toolset.get_entity(id='default')
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { ComposioToolSet } from "composio-core";

const toolset = new ComposioToolSet();
const entity = toolset.client.getEntity(id='default');
```
</CodeGroup>
<Info>If entity ID is not specified, `default` will be used as the entity ID.</Info>

### Connected Accounts
- When a user connects their account, a `connected_account` object is created. 
- **Connected Account** securely stores **authentication data** such as **API keys, access tokens and refresh tokens**.

### Integrations & Connections

**Integration**
- An integration is your app's configuration for services like Gmail or GitHub
- Each integration contains authentication method, API scopes, client credentials and other app settings
- Developers can create multiple integrations with different configurations, learn more [here](../Auth/Integrations#what-is-an-integration)

**Connection**
- A connection links a user to an integration
- Multiple connections can be created for the same integration
- Learn how to use connections [here](../Auth/using-connections)

### Initiating a new connection for your user

<Step title="Import Libraries & Initialize Toolset">

const toolset = new ComposioToolSet();
```
</CodeGroup>

<Step title="Initiate a new connection">
Below are the accepted parameters for initiating a new connection:
- `integration_id`: ID of the existing integration, use this to create a connection for an existing integration, If no integration exists for the given app, new one is automatically created
- `app`: name of the app to create a connection for
- `labels`: labels to be assigned to the connection, which can later be used to filter connections
- `entity_id`: ID of the user for whom the connection is being created
- `redirect_url`: URL to redirect the user to after the connection is created (for OAuth auth scheme). If not provided, the user will be redirected to Composio's connection success/failer page
- `connected_account_params`/`data`: If auth mode is non-OAuth, this is where parameters need to be passed for creating a connection (API key, shopify store name, etc)
- `auth_scheme`: Type of authentication to be used for the connection (OAUTH2 or API_KEY, BASIC_WITH_JWT, etc), OAUTH2 will be defaulted if not provided
- `auth_config`: If auth mode is OAuth, this is where the configuration needs to be provided for creating a connection (client_id, client_secret, etc)

Let's create a connection for the user **default** for the Gmail app.
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Store connection parameters
redirect_url = "https://yourwebsite.com/connection/success"
entity_id = "default" 

connection_request = toolset.initiate_connection(redirect_url=redirect_url, entity_id=entity_id, app=App.GMAIL)
```
```javascript JavaScript
// Store connection parameters
const redirectURL = "https://yourwebsite.com/connection/success"
const entityId = "default" 

const connectionRequest = await toolset.connectedAccounts.initiate({
  appName: "gmail",
  redirectUri: redirectURL,
  entityId: entityId,
  authMode: "OAUTH2",
});
console.log(connectionRequest);
```
</CodeGroup>
Connection request output: 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
connectionStatus='INITIATED'
connectedAccountId='<connected_account_id>'
redirectUrl='https://accounts.google.com...'
```
```bash JavaScript
connectionStatus='INITIATED'
connectedAccountId='<connected_account_id>'
redirectUrl='https://accounts.google.com...'
```
</CodeGroup>
- `connectionStatus`: status of the connection, initially it will be **INITIATED** and will change to **ACTIVE** or **FAILED** after user completes the auth flow
- `connectedAccountId`: ID of the newly created account, you can use this ID to retrieve the connection object
- `redirectUrl`: URL to redirect to perform authentication, post the authentication flow user will be redirect to the page specified in the `redirectUrl` parameter
</Step>
<Step title="Checking the status of the connection">
Use the connectedAccountId to get the detailed information about the connection, learn more [here](../Auth/using-connections).
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
connection = toolset.get_connected_account(id="83f5e791-e6c4-4cd6-8e3a-dada66b0a8f1")
print(connection.status)
```
```javascript JavaScript
const connection = await toolset.connectedAccounts.get({
    connectedAccountId: "<connected_account_id>"
});
console.log(connection.status);
```
</CodeGroup>
Status of the connection can be one of the following:
- `INITIATED`: Connection is initiated but not yet completed
- `ACTIVE`: Connection is active and ready to use
- `FAILED`: Connection failed to be created
</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>Each App integration has a unique **integration ID**. You can use this ID instead of the **app name** when creating connections.</Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Collect parameters required to create a connection">
Get the expected parameters required to create a connection & pass them while initiating a new connection (API Key, Subdomain URL, Username etc.).
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# You can use integration_id instead of app
response = toolset.get_expected_params_for_user(app=App.FIRECRAWL) 
print(response["expected_params"])
```
```javascript JavaScript
const expectedInputFields = await toolset.integrations.getRequiredParams(
    "<app-integration-id>", //integrationId
);
console.log(expectedInputFields);
```
</CodeGroup>
Response:
```bash {3}
[
  ExpectedFieldInput(
  name='api_key',
  type='string',
  description='Your FireCrawl API key for authentication. Obtain it from your FireCrawl settings.',
  displayName='API Key',
  is_secret=False,
  required=True,
  expected_from_customer=True,
  default=None,
  get_current_user_endpoint=None)
]
```
To create a new connection for FireCrawl app, we need the FireCrawl API key

- `integration_id`: ID of the existing integration, use this to create a connection for an existing integration, If no integration exists for the given app, new one is automatically created

Let's create a connection for the user **default** for the FireCrawl app.
<CodeGroup>

entity_id = "default"
collected_params = {"api_key": "<firecrawl_api_key>"}
auth_scheme = "API_KEY"

# Initiate new connection (You can use integration_id instead of app)
connection_request = toolset.initiate_connection(
    connected_account_params=collected_params,
    entity_id=entity_id,
    app=App.FIRECRAWL,
    auth_scheme=auth_scheme,

// Store connection parameters
const entityId = "default";
const collectedParams = {

const authScheme = "API_KEY";

const connection_request = await toolset.connectedAccounts.initiate({
    data: collectedParams,
    entityId: entityId,
    appName: "firecrawl",
    authMode: authScheme,
    authConfig: {}
})
console.log(connection_request)
```
</CodeGroup>
Connection request output:
<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
connectionStatus='ACTIVE' 
connectedAccountId='<connected_account_id>' 
redirectUrl=None
```
```bash JavaScript
connectionStatus='ACTIVE' 
connectedAccountId='<connected_account_id>' 
redirectUrl=None
```
</CodeGroup>
- `connectionStatus`: status of the connection
- `connectedAccountId`: ID of the newly created account, you can use this ID to retrieve the connection object
- `redirectUrl`: URL to redirect to perform authentication, since its not an OAuth type auth scheme, redirectUrl will be None
</Step>
<Step title="Checking the status of the connection">
Use the connectedAccountId to get the detailed information about the connection, learn more [here](../Auth/using-connections).
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
connection = toolset.get_connected_account(id="<connected_account_id>")
print(connection.status)

const connection = await toolset.connectedAccounts.get({
    connectedAccountId: "<connected_account_id>"

console.log(connection.status);
