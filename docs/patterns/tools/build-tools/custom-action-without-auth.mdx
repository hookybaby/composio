<Tip>
Custom Actions are powerful building blocks that enable you to create custom functionality while running independently. They can handle everything from simple data processing to complex third-party integrations.

## Creating a Custom Tool without Authentication

<Steps>
<Step title="Install required libraries">
<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip install composio-openai openai
```
```bash JavaScript
npm install composio-core openai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Import libraries">
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, action
from openai import OpenAI

openai_client = OpenAI()
toolset = ComposioToolSet()
```
```javascript JavaScript
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core"
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { z } from "zod"

const openai_client = new OpenAI();
const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet();
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Creating a custom action">
Below are examples of creating a custom action called `my_custom_action` (Python) & `myCustomAction` (JavaScript) to make cowsay say whatever you want it to say.

You need to add the action, input parameters & return content description, this is what the LLM will use to understand the action.
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
@action(toolname="cow", requires=["cowsay"])
def my_custom_action(message: str) -> str:
    """
    Cow will say whatever you want it to say.

    :param message: Message to be displayed
    :return greeting: Formatted message.
    """
    import cowsay
    
    return cowsay.get_output_string("cow", message)
```
```javascript JavaScript
await toolset.createAction({
    actionName: "myCustomAction",
    description: "Cow will say whatever you want it to say",
    inputParams: z.object({
        message: z.string()
    }),
    callback: async (inputParams) => {
        const message = inputParams.message;
        const cowMessage = `Cow says: ${message}`;
        return cowMessage;
    }
});
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Executing the Custom Action">
Executing the custom action using LLM. Learn how to execute the custom action without LLM [here](/patterns/tools/use-tools/action-guide-without-agents#how-to-execute-custom-actions-directly).
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
tools = toolset.get_tools(actions=[my_custom_action])

task = "Say 'AI is the future' using cowsay"

response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4o-mini",
tools=tools,
messages=
    [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": task},
    ],
)

result = toolset.handle_tool_calls(response)
print(result)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const tools = await toolset.getTools({
    actions: ["myCustomAction"]
});

const instruction = "Say 'AI is the future' using cowsay";

const response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: instruction }],
    tools: tools,
    tool_choice: "auto",
});

const result = await toolset.handleToolCall(response);
console.log(result);
```
</CodeGroup>

Output from executing Custom Action
<CodeGroup>
```shell Python
  ________________
| AI is the future |
  ================
                \
                 \

                       ||----w |
                       ||     ||
```
```shell JavaScript
Cow says: AI is the future
```

### Why Use Custom Tools or Actions?

Custom Tools or Actions provide several advantages:

- **Data privacy:** Execution happens on the user’s machine, ensuring sensitive data doesn’t leave the local environment
- **Flexibility:** Users can create and customize as many tools and actions as needed
- **Compatibility:** Custom actions can be integrated seamlessly across various Composio-supported platforms
